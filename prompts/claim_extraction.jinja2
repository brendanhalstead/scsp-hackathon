As you can see, claims are CONCRETE and FACTUAL. They are FALSIFIABLE and/or VERIFIABLE. For example they should correspond to real, tangible events in the real world. Vague or vacuous claims or opinions are often subjective, whereas regular claims were objective. They also leave some unanswered question and do not establish a clear truth. Below you will get some text. Please give a list of short sentences that establish the claims of the tweet (text). If there are no claims, return an empty list.
